## 🚀 Recent Work & Impact

- **Project Management System (PMS):** Built an enterprise-grade internal system (similar to Jira/Wrike) that unified 8+ departments (SEO, Web, CRM, MIS, Accounts, IT) into a single platform. Implemented role-based access control with React.js and Supabase, enabling task assignment, ticket management, and real-time work tracking—transforming a previously untracked workflow into a systemized operation visible to all stakeholders from team members to CEO.

- **SEO Automation Pipeline:** Engineered an automated data pipeline that reduced SEO reporting time from 1 week to under 1 hour. Built scheduled workflows using Edge Functions and Cron jobs to fetch client rankings (weekly/monthly), GA4 organic users, and GSC clicks/impressions—automatically generating comparison insights and eliminating manual Excel maintenance for the entire SEO team.

- **Customer Analytics Dashboard:** Developed a multi-touchpoint tracking dashboard for an event management company using React.js. Created a source attribution system (Google Ads, Facebook, referrals) that tracks customer journey across multiple events, implements version control for repeat attendees, and identifies high-engagement customers for membership conversion—providing full visibility into customer acquisition and retention patterns.
